# Breast-cancer Detecting using ensemble learning :
Ensemble learning is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of predictive models by combining the outputs of multiple models. In the case of breast cancer detection, ensemble learning can be used to improve the accuracy of predictive models for identifying breast cancer in mammography images.

One approach to using ensemble learning for breast cancer detection is to train multiple models on different subsets of the data or using different machine learning algorithms. These models can then be combined using techniques such as voting or stacking to produce a final prediction. This can help to reduce the impact of individual model biases or errors and improve the overall accuracy of the prediction.

Another approach is to use ensemble learning to combine multiple types of data, such as mammography images and clinical data, to improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection. For example, a model trained on mammography images could be combined with a model trained on clinical data to produce a more accurate prediction.
